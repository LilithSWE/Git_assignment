  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Amanda and I have been in the hobby for about a year and a half. 
  I wouldn't say I paint as regularly as I perhaps should, but I do enjoy painting with friends from time to time. 
  Recently I have joined up in a painting club in Gothenburg on Mondays, so I'm bound to increase the time spent painting going forward!</p>
  <p> You can find more of my work at: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amandasminiatures/">@amandasminatures</a>.</p>`
